| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Initial page load | Load any dashboard page | Show loading spinner until authentication completes | ✅ PASS |
| Session determination | Watch transition from loading to authenticated state | Smooth transition to appropriate dashboard | ✅ PASS |

### 4. Session Persistence

|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Page refresh | Log in and refresh page | Stay on same dashboard | ✅ PASS |
| Browser restart | Close and reopen browser | Session maintained, correct dashboard shown | ✅ PASS |
| Multiple tabs | Open multiple dashboard tabs | Correct dashboard shown in all tabs | ✅ PASS |

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Duplicate Property in NextAuth Options**
   - Found duplicate `debug` property in options.ts
   - Removed redundant property to fix error

2. **Inconsistent Redirection Methods**
   - Standardized use of `window.location.href` for primary redirects
   - Used `router.replace()` for role-specific redirects

3. **Missing Activity Logging**
   - Added consistent activity logging across all dashboard pages
   - Enhanced debugging information for authentication issues

4. **Inconsistent Authentication Patterns**
   - Standardized authentication flow across all pages
   - Implemented consistent loading states

## Code Quality Checks

| Component | Lint Status | TypeScript Status | Error Status |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Login.tsx | PASS | PASS | No errors |
| employee/page.tsx | PASS | PASS | No errors |
| hr/page.tsx | PASS | PASS | No errors |
| manager/page.tsx | PASS | PASS | No errors |
| middleware.ts | PASS | PASS | No errors |
| options.ts | PASS | PASS | No errors |

## Conclusion

The authentication and redirection logic in the HRM project has been successfully fixed. All test cases pass, and the system now correctly redirects users to their appropriate dashboards based on their role. The code is free of errors and follows consistent patterns across all components.
