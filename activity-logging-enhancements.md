# Activity Logging System Enhancements

## Overview
This update enhances the activity logging system to track activities for all employees, not just managers. The system now uses real database entries and properly logs activities throughout the application.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Middleware for Automatic Activity Logging
- Added logging middleware to capture page views automatically
- Integrated with NextAuth to track authenticated user activities
- Added logging to employee, manager, and HR layouts

### 2. Client-Side Activity Tracking
- Created `AutoActivityLogger` component for client-side tracking
- Added activity logging to key user actions:
  - Attendance clock in/out
  - Leave request submission
  - Loan applications
  - Profile updates
  - Payroll viewing

### 3. Backend Improvements
- Fixed MongoDB query by ensuring non-negative skip values
- Added proper error handling and logging to the API routes
- Enhanced MongoDB connection with better error handling
- Implemented `.lean()` for better MongoDB performance

### 4. Logging User Interface
- Added `LogInitializer` component to help create initial log entries
- Created `LogsTester` component for managers to test log creation
- Improved error handling for activity log API

## Testing Steps
1. Log in as each user type (employee, manager, HR)
2. Navigate through different pages and verify logs are created
3. Perform key actions (clock in/out, submit leave requests, etc.)
4. Check the logs page as a manager/HR to verify all activities are captured

## Dependencies
- Next.js Session Management
- MongoDB
- Client-side activity logging

## Notes
- All user types can create logs, but only managers and HR can view them
- Activity logging now spans all key user actions across the application
